			<h2>Machine Learning aided design of materials with target elastic
				properties
			</h2>

			<p>    The construction of crystal feature vector is crucial to machine learning (ML) technique applied in
				materials science. Here, we present a set of universal descriptors which combines atomic properties
				with crystal fingerprint to build interpretable models for elastic property prediction. This approach
				is demonstrated powerful to the prediction of elastic moduli with minor deviations with respect
				to density functional theory (DFT) based calculations. Besides, we develop an effective method
				to evaluate the influence of each descriptor, and find bond strength related properties are most
				important, which indicates that the ML model captures the underlying physics of the bulk and
				shear moduli. Moreover, the projection analysis shows data points with large and small elastic
				moduli are clearly divided into two parts by the average value of volume and atomization enthalpy
				(∆Hatomic), suggesting that compounds composed elements with large ∆Hatomic such as V, Pt, Zr,
				Hf, Ta, Mo, W, Tc, Re, Ru, Os, Ir and non-metallic elements B, C, N, Si, are potential large elastic
				moduli materials. Following this rule, we design a new dynamic stable material ReTcB4 which has
				higher shear modulus than any unexplored materials in the database. This method is valuable for
				high throughout screening and materials design.

				<h2> Low Dimensional Materials</h2>
				<p>We are interested in low dimensional materials, including their electronic
				properties, magnectic properties and superconductivity. These materials have been found to have applications such as the next generation of nanoscale semiconductor devices,
		solar cells and chemical catalyst. Recently, the study of graphene-like materials such
		as silicene, germanene, borophene and monolayer boron-carbon have aroused great interest
		among researchers in the field of condensed matter physics.</p>

				<h2> Machine Learning</h2>
				<p>Density functional theory(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Density_functional_theory"><abbr title="Density functional theory" >DFT</abbr></a>) is a mature technique for calculating the 
				structure and behavior of solids, which enables the development of extensive 
			databases that cover the calculated properties of known and hypothetical systems, including organic and inorgannic crystals, single molecules and metal alloys.
			Given enough data and a rule-discovery algorithm, a computer has the potential to determine all known physical laws without human input. The combination of big data and 
			machine-learning  approaches gives researchers the ability to predict materials' properties, discover new materials or even establish new scientific laws and principles.
